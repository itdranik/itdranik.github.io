In the 15th century, Columbus discovered America, in the 17th century Newton discovered the law of gravity, and already in the 21st century you, my dear reader, have discovered this blog! And although this discovery does not have those enormous proportions, I still hope that you will definitely enjoy this blog.

Therefore, I propose to make a cup of delicious coffee or tea and right now start reading the notes from the IT-wanderer!

Respectfully,  
IT-Dranik
